The null hypothesis is that a selected model predicts $y$ well enough, hence the residuals are roughly Gaussian. A variety of different methods can be used to find an alternative model, for example the lasso using a larger prediction matrix, or random forests. Some measure of accuracy is then compared between the selected (null) model and many bootstrap fits of alternative models. The bootstrap allows construction

Can an alternative model selection method predict the residuals (from the selected model) significantly better than it can predict noise?
